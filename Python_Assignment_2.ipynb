    "Ans. Two values of the boolean data type are - True and False, written with T and F with \n",
    "    rest of the letters in lower case.\n",
    "2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?\n",
    "Ans. and, or & not.\n",

    "values for the operator and what it evaluate).\n",
    "Ans. True and False, using capital T and F, with the rest of the word in lowercase\n",

    "condition and when you would use one.\n",
    "Ans. == is the equal to operator that compares two values and evaluates to a Boolean,\n",
    "    while = is the assignment operator that stores a value in a variable.\n",
    "    A condition is an expression used in a cotrol flow statement that evaluates to a\n",

    "Ans. The break statement will move the execution outside and just after a loop. The continue \n",

    "    range(0, 10) explicitly tells the loop to start at 0, and range(0, 10, 1) explicitly tells the \n",
