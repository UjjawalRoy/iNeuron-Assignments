    "Ans. Functions are advantageous to have in functions as they help to \n",
    "    automate a piece of code which is being used multiple times in a program.\n",
    "2. When does the code in a function run: when it is called?\n",
    "Ans. When it is called.\n",
    "3. What statement creates a function?\n",
    "Ans. def statement helps to create a function.\n",
    "4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",

    "    A function call is a callable object which can take some arguments and return\n",
    "    an object.\n",
    "5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "Ans. There is only one global scope per program execution. There can be multiple\n",
    "    local scopes in a python program.\n",
    "6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "Ans. A local variable retains its value until the next time the function is called \n",
    "    A local variable becomes undefined after the function call completes The local \n",
    "    variable can be used outside the function any time after the function call completes.\n",
    "7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "Ans. A return statement is used to end the execution of the function call and “returns” the result\n",
    "    (value of the expression following the return keyword) to the caller.\n",

    "Ans. The return value of the function bears a NoneType value.\n",
    "9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "As. If you want to refer to a global variable in a fucntion, then you have to declare which variables are global\n",
    "     using the 'global' keyword.\n",

    "Ans. None is of the data type NoneType.\n",

    "13. What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?\n",
    "Ans. Place the statement which may cause a crash error into a try clause.\n",
    "14. What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?\n",
    "Ans. A code that could potenntially cause an error goes innto the try clause.\n",
    "    A code that executes if ann error happens goes into the except clause."
